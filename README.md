# Raytracer

A simple renderer following a ray-tracing algorithm.

## Architecture
We use a layer-based architecture where the top layer depends on lower layers where lower layers need not have any implementation knowledge of how they are used by high layers. This allows us to seperate concerns in a modular way.

1. Application Layer (`/Core`): User interface settings and control
2. Rendering Layer (`/Renderer`): Implements ray-tracing algorithm and post-processing
3. Scene Layer (`/Scene`, `/Material`): Scene, camera, lights, materials, mediums, and texture
4. Geometry Layer (`/Geometry`): Primitive definitions, intersection tests, and acceleration structure
5. Low-level Platform Layer (`/Platform` and `/Backend`): Window creation, input handling, swapchain, graphics backend, and thread pools
